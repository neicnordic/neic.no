New report on high performance computing in the Nordics
=======================================================

**Nordic researchers are becoming increasingly dependent on digital research infrastructure.**

<a href="/assets/images/news/cognitus.jpg"> <img class="smallpic" src="/assets/images/news/cognitus.jpg"> </a>

The report was commissioned by NeIC and prepared by an external expert, Dr. Rob Pennington, Deputy Director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Among Penningtons recommendations are an expanded role for NeIC and an international HPC-programme incorporated into national strategies.
