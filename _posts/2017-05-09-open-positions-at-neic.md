**NeIC is looking for one or two Project Managers for our Biodiversity Informatics and Earth System Modelling projects that will work to facilitate and intensify collaboration on e-infrastructure in these fields.**

NeIC is seeking one or two Project Managers within e-infrastructures for biodiversity informatics and earth system modelling. We encourage both current NeIC staff and new candidates to apply. Both projects have three-year duration and are now entering execution phase.

The ideal candidates have excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-infrastructure services. Candidates are expected to have a genuine interest in developing skills in project management for distributed teams and in providing value-added services to researchers. For such candidates NeIC will offer flexible work arrangement, stimulating colleagues, systematic training and practice in the PPS project model. It is expected that the candidates are employed at a national e-infrastructure organization or one of its collaborating institutions. Candidates must have a good command of English (both written and spoken). The position(-s) entail a wide variety of interesting tasks and involve extensive contact with research groups and specialist communities in the Nordic countries and internationally. Some travelling will be required.

NeIC Project Managers report to the Executive Team and to the Project Steering Group. The general functions and responsibilities of the Project Manager include:

*	Leading work in the distributed team towards deliveries and successful project completion.
*	Maintaining an active requirements dialogue with stakeholders or reference groups.
*	Developing and maintaining a detailed project plan.
*	Overseeing the selection of project staff.
*	Providing regular progress reports about the project.
*	Producing the final report upon project completion.

An overarching goal of the project Nordic-Baltic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Biodiversity Informatics is to facilitate and to intensify collaboration on e-infrastructure topics for biodiversity informatics in the Nordic-Baltic region. Hence, it is important that the project's tasks link to regional activities by following them, by inviting their participation to (public) meetings, and by providing added value to them.

The project Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling aims at networking, intensifying existing collaboration, and facilitating joint work on very specific topics helping, for example, building up knowledge and competency, and harmonising certain procedures concerning e-infrastructure topics. More information regarding the project:
[https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Earth_system_modeling](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Earth_system_modeling)

Each project has an estimated 25% FTE workload for management. This can be covered by one person managing both projects at 50% FTE or two project managers at 25% FTE commitment each over a maximum three years.
All new positions will be available from August 1st. Questions may be directed to Gudmund Høst, Director of NeIC, tel. [+47 9581684](tel:+479581684). Applications including CV should be submitted to [gudmund.host@nordforsk.org](mailto:gudmund.host@nordforsk.org) within June 1st , 2017. Applications should include a support letter from a national e-infrastructure organisation in one of the Nordic countries.
