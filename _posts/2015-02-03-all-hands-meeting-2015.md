The program included team building and technical sessions, in plenary and smaller groups. Ample time was allowed for informal talks and networking. NeIC currently has three major teams working on development and operations of Nordic services. The Nordic Tier-1 team coordinates the Nordic contribution to the global WLCG service for high-energy physics. The Tryggve team develops services for sensitive data within the bio- and medical sciences. The Glenna team collaborate on cloud services of common interest to the five national e-infrastructure providers.
