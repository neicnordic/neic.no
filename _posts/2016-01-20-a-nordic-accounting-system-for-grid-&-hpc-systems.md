A Nordic accounting system for Grid & HPC systems
=================================================

**The NeIC project SGAS is an accounting system for Grid and HPC systems that began as part of the Swedish Grid project SweGrid. The project was completed 30 September 2015**

The NeIC project SGAS is an accounting system for Grid and HPC systems that began as part of the Swedish Grid project SweGrid. The project was started on 1 October 2013 and was completed 30 September 2015, with Magnus Jonsson as project leader. Project activities during this period included efforts to further develop and maintain the software.

Today, SGAS is used within NeIC NT1, the SNIC SAMS project, UNINETT Sigma2 and at CSC in Finland. All of the users depend on the core functions of SGAS for reporting on CPU (Central Processing Unit) and storage usage within and outside of the organisation.

The core functions of SGAS today are very reliable and efficient, with only minor bugs reported and fixed during the project lifetime. Most of the development work has been focused on making SGAS a software that is easy to maintain in the future.

Five releases of the SGAS suite were launched and four workshops on accounting were held during the project period.

To ensure that SGAS remains a software that can be used within the respective Nordic sites and others, it is essential to continue refining and developing the stable framework on which it is based.
