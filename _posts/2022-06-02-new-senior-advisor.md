Oikarinen has a background in Social Sciences and a Master's Degree in International Relations from the University of Tampere. He has worked in different positions at CSC since 2017. At NeIC, he will be investigating international funding opportunities in the Nordic region and the EU. Together with the rest of the Executive team, he will look for opportunities to expand the Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration in new directions. 

– I feel excited to begin working in the Executive team as the position offers me a great opportunity to utilise my existing knowledge related to RDI funding and projects to support NeIC in its ambitions regarding new collaborations. It also enables further development of collaboration between NeIC and CSC. My time at CSC has given me a great chance to support Finnish research and I find the possibility to support research beyond national efforts through NeIC very motivating, Oikarinen says.
