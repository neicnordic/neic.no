New report on The State of Open Science in the Nordic Countries
===========================

The Nordic countries are particularly well suited for collaboration among each other due to social and cultural similarities. Also, as the
countries are individually small, unifying efforts in science and technology to realise common undertakings will generally result in a
better end-product and greater impact in the international arena. Finally, a Nordic-wide collaboration reduces the risks of duplication
of effort and therefore promotes a more cost-efficient R&D segment within the Nordics. 

In 2017 the NeIC Board identified “data management” as a subject that was not being sufficiently addressed in the NeIC project portfolio.
The Board recommended that NeIC should direct some effort towards data management and, given the importance of research data in general 
and the onset of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) in the European arena, this seems timely and appropriate. 

The report on [The State of Open Science in the Nordic Countries: Enabling Data Science in the Nordic Region](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/e/ef/The_state_of_open_science_in_the_Nordic_countries_spreads.pdf), written by Andreas Jaunsen on
behalf NeIC, seeks to identify activities that can help to improve the conditions and means for enabling data-driven science in the 
Nordics. In particular, the relevance to EOSC and the greater visions of Open Science have emerged as an appropriate setting for this
report.
