Register for Nordic CompBio Week 2023!
===========================

We are excited to announce Nordic CompBio Week, a new and open hybrid bioinformatics conference that will begin on 6th November 2023. The conference has a format where participating Nordic regions have conference programmes taking place in-person, and sessions will be live-streamed for virtual attendance. The conference will start off with the Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop that will take place in Stockholm, followed by the programme in Lyngby (Denmark) and then Kuopio (Finland)!

Everybody is warmly welcome to attend regardless of academic level; while our primary target audience is people in the Nordic academic and industrial environment, the conference is open to all for virtual attendance. Register soon [here](https://bit.ly/register-for-ncb-week). For updates on conference schedule, please visit [this website](https://bit.ly/ncb-week-2023).

We hope to see you next month!
