FAIR Awareness Day: Towards Automatic Data Re-Use
===========================

FAIR Data is data that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by computers. This full day seminar provides an introduction to
what the FAIRification of (research) data entails, how it promotes open science (Open by default, closed as necessary) and why this is 
part of good practice in Data Stewardship. Moreover, new requirements from national and international funders are driving the need for 
training of competent, professional data stewards and data managers with knowledge of the FAIR principles and their application. In turn,
this drives FAIR Data Stewardship as a new profession, and is rapidly gaining momentum throughout the Nordic states and Europe. 

The seminars are given by **Albert Mons** and **Erik Schultes** (GO-FAIR) [(GO-FAIR)](https://www.go-fair.org/). It is an introduction to a training course that will provide the foundation skills for professional data stewards, to be held in Oslo 25-28 March, 2019.
