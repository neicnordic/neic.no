Project personell within the Glenna project came together to demonstrate the cloud services available so far for their colleagues, get a glimpse of upcoming versions' features and directly test each others services in a hands-on-tutorial. The services are linked from the <a href="https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Glenna_Portal">Glenna Portal</a> and most of them are already accessible via Kalmar2.

A workshop is in the planning to present the services to a broader audience in the future.
