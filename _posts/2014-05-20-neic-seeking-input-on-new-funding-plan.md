- The current funding plan focuses heavily on biomedicine as an area that can benefit greatly from joint Nordic e-infrastructure, says Gudmund Høst, Director of the NeIC.

- Now we want to hear what the research community thinks our next funding plan should emphasise, and this is why we call for letters of interest.

The NeIC is looking for ideas about research fields of common Nordic interest which can be further advanced by the development of high-quality e-infrastructure.

The deadline for submitting a letter of interest is 15 May 2014. Submissions will be presented to the NeIC board, which is responsible for adopting the new funding plan.
