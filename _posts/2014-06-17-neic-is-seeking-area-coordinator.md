NeIC is seeking Area Coordinator
================================

**Do you want to be a part of our team? NeIC is seeking a new area coordinator who can further develop the Generic Area as well as coordinate existing projects.**

The Generic Area deals with development of tools and services applicable to a broad range of users. The national e-Infrastructure providers constitute the main stakeholders and participants in the activities within this area.

The Generic Area plays an important role in the cross-fertilization of ideas between NeIC areas. Some examples of opportunities within the Generic Area include Nordic HPC collaboration, federated cloud services, accounting, and data services. The Generic Area Coordinator interacts closely with the national and Nordic level e-Infrastructure providers in the development of this activity area.

The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-Infrastructure services. Candidates will be expected to have experience in managing projects, relevant higher education and broad knowledge of technologies used in e-Infrastructures for research.

The position has a term of up to four years, with the possibility of extension. In the short term we need a temporary replacement our current Generic Area Coordinator who will go on maternity leave, but in the longer term we need to strengthen our coordinating efforts to harvest Nordic opportunities within both generic and community-specific services.

The Generic Area Coordinator is expected to have 50-80% of his/her time committed to NeIC, the remaining time being committed to his/her home institution in one of the Nordic countries.

Questions about the position may be directed to Gudmund Høst, Director of NeIC, tel. +47 9581684.

Applications including CV should be submitted to neic@nordforsk.org within June 26th.
