"Collaboration between the Nordic countries on research e-infrastructures makes it possible to plan and implement infrastructure services in cost efficient and optimal way. By sharing responsibilities, we can benefit from the different competences between resource providers. The key to success is trust and open sharing of knowledge and services between the Nordic countries. Eventually, this will materialize in better services for Nordic research communities. NeIC has a critical role in this process," states Pekka Lehtovuori.
