Sign up for course "An Introduction to FAIR data stewardship"
===========================

The EOSC-Nordic project offers internal and external participants a chance to participate in a 3-day intensive introductory course on FAIR data stewardship. The course takes place at DTU - Technical University of Denmark on 11-13 October and aims at introducing the participant to the knowledge required to understand and apply the FAIR principles on data and metadata. It focuses on the understanding of the principles, their analysis and on the process to make existing data FAIR.

<img class="normal" src="{% include baseurl %}/assets/images/EOSC_Nordic_logo_new.png" height="100" style="float: right"> A significant part in FAIR relates to supporting the ability of artificial agents to interpret discovered information and act accordingly. This is achieved using semantic techniques such as ontologies, Linked Data and Semantic Web, that are also addressed in the course. During the course, participants will conduct some exercises to practice the acquired knowledge.

**What:** A 3-day course on FAIR data stewardship with introductory sessions and some practical applications.  
**Who:** EOSC-Nordic (NordForsk) is offering the course through a partnership with Datability for anyone interested.  
**When:** 11-13 October 2022.  
**How much:** 6000 NOK for regular registrants. EOSC-Nordic members can attend free of cost.  
**What else:** Elements of this course will be offered as an online course in the near future. However, on this occasion, the course is being offered as a compressed version of at least two course modules. 

Registration is open until 10 October. [Click here to access the registration page for more information](https://www.deltager.no/event/fair2022-eoscn).
