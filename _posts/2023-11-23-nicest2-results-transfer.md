A triumph of collaboration and innovation: transferring the results of NICEST2
===========================
*This text is written together with Anne Fouilloux. It is inspired by an article by the NICEST2 team, ['Building on Communities to Further Software Sustainability'](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2023.3318749).*

The second phase of the Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling project, NICEST2, finished and entered NeIC’s One-year Results-transfer period in June. NICEST2 started in 2020 and was very successful in strengthening the Nordic region’s position in climate modelling as well as introducing and implementing FAIR practices in climate research. 

– NICEST2's success is etched in its ability to efficiently run ESMs, champion Open Science, and position the Nordic community within the European Open Science Cloud. The structured approach adopted, embracing best software practices and cultivating a community of practice, has been the cornerstone of the project's achievements. NICEST2 exemplifies the triumph of collaboration and innovation. Success emerges not just from the mastery of codes but from the wisdom to forge a community that breathes life into sustainable practices, declares **Anne Fouilloux**, project manager for NICEST2. 


Fouilloux will continue working in NICEST2 until 31 May 2024 and act as a coordinator during the Results-transfer period. During the one-year prolongation, the coordinator together with NeIC will support the transfer of project’s outcome to partners and this way increase its impact. A sustainability plan for a NeIC project is usually created before the project work even starts, but handing out of services, tools and information does not happen overnight when the project ends. In the case of NICEST2, transferring the results means actively sharing valuable knowledge, cultivating a collaborative community, and implementing best practices that extend beyond the project's conclusion. This includes open-sourcing developed codes, providing comprehensive documentation, engaging with wider scientific communities, and participating in initiatives like Pangeo, The Galaxy Project and the EOSC to empower researchers with practical tools for sustainable scientific endeavours.

#### Cultivating Knowledge Transfer
##### Open Science Initiatives:
NICEST2's commitment to Open Science is a cornerstone of its legacy. The project emphasises the importance of transparent, accessible, and collaborative research practices. As the curtains close, the knowledge cultivated within NICEST2 is transferred through comprehensive documentation, best practices guides, and engaging with wider scientific communities.

##### Best Software Practices:
The structured approach to software development within NICEST2 is a valuable asset to be shared. By open-sourcing developed codes, adopting standardised practices, and contributing to initiatives such as the Pangeo and EOSC, the project ensures the seamless transfer of software-related expertise to a broader audience by delivering Platform as a Service such as Pangeo@EOSC.

#### Community Transfer
##### Inclusive Collaborative Models:
NICEST2's community structure is more than a closed chapter; it serves as a blueprint for sustainable collaboration. The project actively persists in continuing and transferring community-building strategies. By sharing experiences and insights, NICEST2 catalyses the growth of collaborative ecosystems. This extends beyond the Nordic Earth System Modelling Communities, fostering efficient collaboration to support missions like adaptation to climate change.

##### Synergies with Larger Communities:
NICEST2's success is not insular but interconnected. The project identified synergies with larger communities, creating a ripple effect of shared learning and value exchange. By actively participating in external initiatives, NICEST2 ensures that its collaborative spirit permeates through diverse scientific landscapes.

#### Reproducibility Transfer
##### Clear Documentation and Data Sharing:
Ensuring the reproducibility of research findings is a crucial aspect for the NICEST2 community. The project focuses on meticulous documentation, data sharing practices, aiming at adhering to FAIR principles. This transfer of reproducibility standards contributes to the credibility and longevity of scientific advancements.

#### Collaboration Transfer
##### Building Bridges in Research:
NICEST2's collaborative ethos extends beyond its boundaries. The project actively seeks to transfer the spirit of collaboration, forming bridges with other research initiatives. By establishing networks of shared expertise and resources, NICEST2 contributes to the broader ecosystem of collaborative scientific research.

#### Policy and Framework Transfer
##### Advocacy for Sustainable Research:
As NICEST2 concludes, its impact on research policies and frameworks can become instrumental. The project advocates for the adoption of policies aligned with Open Science, FAIR principles, and sustainable research practices. Engaging with policymakers and funding agencies, NICEST2 would become a catalyst for systemic change.

### Conclusion
NICEST2's journey doesn't end; it transforms into a legacy that transcends temporal boundaries. The transfer of results is not a mere handover: it's a conscious effort to nurture growth, inspire collaboration, and propel Earth System Modeling into a future marked by openness, sustainability, and shared knowledge. As NICEST2's seeds take root, they promise to bloom into a vibrant tapestry of innovation, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of scientific research.
