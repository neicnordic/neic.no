Anne Fouilloux continues as manager for NICEST2
===========================

In August 2022, we announced that we have an open position for a new manager in the NICEST2 project. After the process was completed, **Anne Fouilloux** was chosen to continue as the project manager of NICEST2 until the end of the project in May 2023 with a new agreement with [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no), her new home organisation.

Simula Research Laboratory started as a partner organisation in NeIC earlier this year through [the NordIQuEst project](https://neic.no/nordiquest/). Simula is also one of the three Norwegian partners in the LUMI-Q consortium that was recently chosen by the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking to build a quantum computer. The LUMI-Q quantum computer will be a new computational partition in  the LUMI supercomputer in Finland and be located in Czechia, at the IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Centre in Ostrava.

– Anne has proven to be a very competent, energetic, and committed project manager. Therefore I’m very happy that she will continue to lead NICEST2 which I’m confident will be a great success, says the project owner **Abdulrahman Azab**.
