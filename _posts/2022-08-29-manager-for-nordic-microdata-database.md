Open manager position in new project called Nordic Microdata Database
===========================
We are looking for a manager for a new NeIC project, Nordic Microdata Database. The project is expected to start in December 2022 and run for 2 years. We hope that the project manager could start as soon as possible, preferably in October. The contract period is until the end of the project plus 1-2 months. The project manager is expected to commit 50% of a full-time equivalent to the project.

The Nordic Microdata Database project will work to create a joint Nordic database of registry data for academic research on companies and households. The initiative is governed by academics representing leading Nordic universities and business schools in the fields of economics and financial economics, and has core funding from the Nordic Council of Ministers. 

The project will be managed by a dedicated project manager, with the key responsibilities as set out by NeIC. The project manager is to lead the distributed development team to the successful completion of the Nordic Microdata Database project. This includes a range of tasks, from leadership and task prioritisation to stakeholder engagement and classic project follow-up. The project manager will report to the project owner.

It is anticipated that candidates are employed at a national e-infrastructure organisation in one of the NeIC countries, or a collaborating institution. For candidates that are qualified but not employed at one of the above mentioned organisations, NeIC offers to negotiate an employment relation. Staff are normally sub-contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the national employer institution and NeIC, with the aim of enhancing Nordic collaboration. We encourage both current NeIC staff and new candidates to apply.

We ask interested candidates to read [the announcement for this position](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/5/59/220800-NordicMicroDataDatabase-manager-position.pdf) and send their application letter and CV to openpositions@neic.no. The deadline for applications is **September 20th, 2022 or until the position is filled**. If you have any questions about the project or NeIC, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact project owner Tomasz Malkiewicz.
