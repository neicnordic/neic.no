Nordic FAIR Data Stewardship Week - Oslo, 13-17 November 2023
===========================

The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) will hold an advanced course and a workshop on FAIR data stewardship on 13-17 November 2023.  This is intended for data professionals who wish to expand their skills and meet/discuss with like-minded colleagues across the Nordics and beyond.
The full program runs over a full week and is divided into 3 parts (you may register for the full week or for individual parts). The programme consists of: 

### Advanced course: FAIRification planning & execution workshop, with a case study (November 13-14th) 

The first day and a half is a recap of certain FAIR data stewardship skills needed for the exercises on Nov 14, where one or more use cases will be used to demonstrate the steps needed for the FAIRification process. This part will provide participants with a methodology for planning and executing FAIRification, which involves making data resources FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) according to set goals and priorities. 

_The course should build on the foundational knowledge acquired in the **” Introduction to FAIR Data Stewardship”** course._

**Tutor:** Luiz Bonino, who has previously tutored part of the introduction course on FAIR data stewardship and is associated with the international GO-FAIR office in Leiden.

### Workshop: Sharing experiences from data stewardship and Lessons learned on practices in data management (November 15th)

The second part is in the format of a workshop where participants are invited to share their experiences working as data stewards, data curators, or other data management professionals. We will also host a discussion on future course curriculum, training needs

**Chair:** TBD

### Advanced Course: Conceptual data modeling, ontologies, and data interoperability (November 16-17th)

The course will introduce practitioners to the theory and practice of Ontology Engineering, with a particular focus on the engineering of FAIR ontologies. As ontologies play a critical role in data interoperability, the course will demonstrate how to design ontologies for interoperability using a domain-independent common-sense theory constructed from suitable contributions from areas such as philosophical ontology and logics, cognitive science, and linguistics. The course will cover advanced modeling techniques such as ontology design patterns, anti-patterns, and methodological guidelines, based on the foundations of OntoUML ontology representation language. Participants will learn how to solve classical and recurrent modeling problems in concrete application scenarios. Finally, the course will demonstrate how OntoUML ontologies can be properly translated to OWL using the gUFO framework.
The advanced course is a unique opportunity to learn from the best. It is intended for those who wish to learn and possibly work within data integration, semantic interoperability, and ontologies.

**Tutor:** Prof. Giancarlo Guizzardi, who is among the most highly regarded capacities in Data modeling and semantic interoperability
