A story of success: EOSC in the Nordics & Baltics – regional events in Tallinn
===========================
*This article was originally published on the [EOSC-Nordic website](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/a-story-of-success-eosc-in-the-nordics-baltics-regional-events-in-tallinn/) on 11 November 2022.*

Almost 150 people registered for on-site participation across our three-day event, and to top it off, we also had remote participants. It was rewarding to see so many participants there, networking and sharing expertise.

### The First EOSC Nordic-Baltic Tripartite Meeting
It was a great opportunity for EOSC-Nordic to support the organisation of the first EOSC tripartite event in the Nordic and Baltic countries. The event brought together the most active EOSC ambassadors of the region spanning from ministerial representatives active in the EOSC Steering Board to research performing organisations working on Open Science and FAIR, from the representatives of the EOSC mandated organisations and national structures to the national infrastructure providers. The European and the EOSC Association provided the European perspective on the latest EOSC developments, and the countries reflected on the impact and the follow-up actions.

A short post-event report was also published on the EOSC Association website. You can read the report [here](https://www.eosc.eu/news/first-eosc-tripartite-event-nordic-and-baltic-countries).

### The end or a new beginning – The Final event of the EOSC-Nordic project
EOSC-Nordic is the result of a Nordic-Baltic collaboration between 24 partner institutions, bridging e-Infrastructure providers, research communities, archive holders, ministries, funding agencies, as well as national, European, and international Open Science experts, etc., in one big and pan-European collaboration!
We were grateful to share the Key Exploitable Results that the valuable EOSC-Nordic consortium has generated in the last three years.
