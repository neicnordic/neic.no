Letters of interest have now been published
===========================================

**The letters of Interest received by the deadline on May 15 2014 has now been published. NeIC received a total of 10 Letters of Interest, and these will form valuable input to the development of our new funding plan.**

NeIC invited the research community to come up with ideas about research fields of common Nordic interest which can be further advanced by the development of high-quality e-infrastructure. The response from the research community was good, and the letters received are now being assessed.

You can find the Letters of Interest on the [NeIC Public Wiki](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Letters_of_interest)
