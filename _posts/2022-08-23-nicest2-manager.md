Wanted: project manager for NICEST2
===========================

We are looking for a project manager for [NICEST2](https://neic.no/nicest2/), the second phase of the Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling. The project started in June 2020 and will run until 31 May 2023. It focuses on strengthening the Nordic position within climate modelling by leveraging, reinforcing and complementing ongoing initiatives. It builds on previous efforts within NICEST (a 3-year NeIC project as of 2017-01) and NordicESM (3-year NordForsk funded project from 2014-12).

The project manager reports to the NeIC project owner and leads a distributed team of professionals. The project manager is also a part of NeIC's project managers' and project owners' forum, where we share experiences, knowledge and best practices to improve our work. The project manager is expected to commit 50% of a full-time equivalent to the project starting in October 2022. The job requires some travelling. 

The project manager should demonstrate deep insight into the entire NICEST2 project, good knowledge of climate science, as well as the ability to promote efficient collaboration. In addition to commanding the general principles of project management, the manager should have experience or interest in being involved in large projects related to the deployment and maintenance of e-infrastructure for Earth System Models (ESMs) and/or more generally e-infrastructure for Open Climate Science at the EU and national levels.

If you think you could be a good fit, have a look at [the full announcement for this position](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/2/25/220800-NICEST2-PM-position-announcement.pdf) and send your application letter and CV to openpositions@neic.no **no later than 12 September 2022**. The applications are read even before this, so the sooner you send yours, the better. If you have any questions about the project or NeIC in general, you can contact the project owner Abdulrahman Azab (abdulrahman.azab@usit.uio.no).
