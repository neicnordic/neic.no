Register for NeIC2022!
===========================

The NeIC 2022 conference will be held in Oslo, at Soria Moria Hotel and Conference Center, from 30 May to 1 June 2022. The conference celebrates NeIC's 10-year anniversary and is an opportunity to connect in 3D after a long era of video conferences and online-only meetings. Title of the conference is **Nordic Models for Open Science Collaboration**.

Digitalization and the green transition are at the top of the EU's research and innovation policy agenda, paralleling the Nordic Council of Ministers' vision for the Nordic region to become the world's most sustainable and integrated region by 2030. Open research and data sharing will be a pillar in the concrete work to be undertaken in strengthening the Nordic leadership in European research and innovation. By offering sessions in the conference programme that are interesting to both decision-makers and researchers, we hope to create an opportunity to bring the success stories of Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration to the attention of the political level. The complete conference programme can be seen [here](https://indico.neic.no/event/204/timetable/#20220530).

The three-day programme consists of various interesting keynote speeches, a [workshop titled "EOSC in the Nordics: from policy to practice"](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/events/workshop-eosc-in-the-nordics-from-policy-to-practice/), presentations from policy-makers and ministers, sessions focusing on data management, and hands-on workshops. There are also several related satellite events taking place before, during and after the conference.

Visit the [official conference page](https://indico.neic.no/event/204/) and make sure to register before 28 March. We look forward to seeing you in Oslo!
