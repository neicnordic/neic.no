# Open call for course mobility and travel grants

The [Ratatosk](/ratatosk) Nordic mobility enhancement programme efforts are directed to increasing the opportunities for trainees in two ways: student mobility via travel grants and course mobility.

## Ratatosk Travel grants available
You can now apply for a [travel grant](https://neic.no/training/travel-grant/) offered by the NeIC Ratatosk Travel Mobility Enhancement Programme - the grant will provide or supply travel funding for staff and end users (researchers) of the Nordic e-infrastructure community who can benefit from access to training programs offered in other Nordic countries. 
The first cut-off date is set to **October 2, 2017**. The second cut-off is scheduled for **October 16, 2017**.

## Open Call for Course Mobility
Furthermore, we are happy to announce an [open call for course mobility](https://neic.no/training/course-mobility/) proposals. NeIC’s Ratatosk mobility enhancement programme is a framework for transferring courses, extend and/or supplement national training efforts (even across national borders) in a Nordic context. The main target group for the open call for course course mobility are presenters (teachers, trainers and instructors) who want to open up their courses to a Nordic audience.
The application process is available from September 15, 2017 to **October 15, 2017**.
