Attend an introductory lecture to get to know Nextflow
===========================

A lecture introducing Nextflow will take place on Monday, 26 February at the University of Tartu and online. 

#### Description of the lecture

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) is a popular domain-specific language and a workflow engine for writing and executing highly scalable, reproducible scientific workflows. Nextflow has many features that make it extremely well suited for writing bioinformatics workflows that rely extensively on command-line tools and large input files in various formats. In this 90-minute workshop, you will be given a short overview of what Nextflow is, how it works and how to get started with writing your own Nextflow workflows. Practical exercises will be demonstrated on the computerome.dk platform.

If you feel like this could be beneficial for you, the lecture is on [26 February at 14:15-15:45 EET on Zoom](https://ut-ee.zoom.us/j/92181337446?pwd=dCtZcWw1bFM2QTVDeGx5aFJNOHlLdz09)!
