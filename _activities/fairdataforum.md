## Nordic-Baltic FAIR Data Forum


### Background

Nordic-Baltic FAIR Data Forum brings together researchers, data stewards, service providers, repository owners, and activity funders in one community to learn from each other, plan for training, competence-building (e.g. training events and workshops), and collaboration activities (including Nordic/EU-funded projects).
