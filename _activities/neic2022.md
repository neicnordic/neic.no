The NeIC 2022 conference title is Nordic Models for Open Science Collaboration. It will also be a celebration of NeIC's 10-year anniversary and an opportunity to connect in 3D after a long era of video conferences and online-only meetings. In 2022, Norway will hold the chairmanship of the Nordic Council of Ministers, which has affected the programme planning of the conference. By offering programme sessions that are interesting to both decision-makers and researchers, we hope to create an opportunity to bring the success stories of Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration to the attention of the political level. 

Registration to NeIC2022 is closed.
