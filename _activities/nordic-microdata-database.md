## Nordic Microdata Database

The goal of the Nordic Microdata Database project is to create a one-stop service to Nordic corporate microdata, which will lead to an improved research landscape and information for policy makers. The project aims at increasing the quantity of high-quality research into policy-relevant questions in economics and finance. 

The project is funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers.
