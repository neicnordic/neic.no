## Nordic-Baltic Sensitive Data Forum


### Background

Nordic-Baltic Sensitive Data Forum brings together researchers, service providers, security experts, service developers/administrators, data protection experts, lawyers, policymakers, and activity funders in one community to learn from each other, plan for competence-building (e.g. training events and workshops), and collaboration activities (including Nordic/EU-funded projects).
