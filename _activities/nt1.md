## Nordic WLCG tier-1 facility

The Nordic distributed tier-1 facility for the worldwide computing grid serving
the large hadron collider at CERN.

NDGF Tier1 is one of 14 regional computing centres of the [Worldwide LHC
Computing Grid](http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/)  â€“ the huge international
e-infrastructure built to provide  computing and storage for the
[CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/). This Nordic solution is unique in  being
distributed across four countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and  Sweden. All
resources: [All WLCG resources](http://wlcg-rebus.cern.ch/core/pledge/list/).

### Supported research

#### ALICE
[ALICE](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html) is one of the experiments
at the LHC, largely dedicated to studies  of quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion
collisions. It uses NDGF Tier1 together  with six other Tier1 centres across the
planet. All four NDGF countries  host ALICE computing and storage resources.

#### ATLAS
[ATLAS](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/Collaboration/) is the largest LHC
experiment, dedicated to searches of new particles  and phenomena in
proton-proton collisions. NDGF Tier1 is one of 10 Tier1  centres used by ATLAS.
Three  NDGF countries, Denmark, Norway and Sweden,  host ATLAS computing and
storage.

### Services provided

#### dCache
Storage of NDGF Tier1 is distributed across many computing centres. The
dCache system, developed with contribution from NeIC, takes care of
orchestrating data stored on disks and tapes all over Scandinavia. It also
accepts data from CERN and other Tier1 centres.

### Operations
A number of additional services are necessary for a Grid center operations.
These include VOMS, FTS, BDII, SAM tests, and of course smooth network
services. NDGF Tier1 uses these products as provided by their respective
developers and [EGI](http://www.egi.eu/).  

### NLCG committee
Nordic LHC Computing Grid ([NLCG](https://wiki.neic.no/int/NLCG)) Committee is a NeIC body that oversees CERN-related activities, such as Nordic Tier1 implementation and interactions with ATLAS, ALICE and CMS experiments at CERN. The NLCG Committee is governed by Terms of Reference approved by the NeIC Board and has agreed to act as a reference group for the Nordic Tier-1 activity within NeIC.

### Collaborations
 * [Worldwide LHC Computing Grid](http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/)
 * [dCache software development](https://www.dcache.org)
 * [ARC software development](https://www.nordugrid.org)
