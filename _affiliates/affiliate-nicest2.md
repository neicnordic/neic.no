**NICEST2** - the second phase of the **Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling** focused on strengthening the Nordic position within climate modeling by leveraging, reinforcing and complementing ongoing initiatives. It built on previous efforts within NICEST (a 3-year NeIC project as of 2017-01) and NordicESM (3-year NordForsk funded project from 2014-12).
