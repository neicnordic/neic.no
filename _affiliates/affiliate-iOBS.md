## About iOBS - Improved Observation Usage in Numerical Weather Prediction

Currently the iOBS project is in the NeIC extended affiliate programme. [More information here.](https://neic.no/news/2021/06/24/extended-affiliate-programme/
)

### Background

United Weather Centres (UWC) is a cooperation between the meteorological institutes of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia on running their forecast weather models. Until 2027, the effort is split into two parts: UWC East (Finland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) who will expand an already operational cooperation between Norway, Finland and Sweden known as MetCoOp, and UWC West (Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands and Ireland) who are forming a new partnership.
Both will be effective from 2022, and merged by 2027.
