## Ratatosk Mobility Enhancement Travel Grant

### Purpose
The goal of training is to raise competence in staff and end users which leads to more effective and productive work by the Nordic e-infrastructure community. The benefits include more efficient operations and use of resources and an improved capability for the researchers in conducting research.
 
### Who can apply
This grant under [The NeIC Ratatosk Mobility Enhancement Programme](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Ratatosk#Public_documents) is intended to provide or supplement travel funding for staff and end users (researchers) of the Nordic e-infrastructure community who can benefit from access to training programs offered in other Nordic countries.
 
### Requirements
Only courses/modules directly related to current national and Nordic e-infrastructure training needs will be applicable for support. The application form is mandatory and can be found below.
Technically the specific course or module has to be embodied in the [NeIC Training Calendar](https://neic.no/training). If you think the course you are interested in is of Nordic relevance and therefore should be part of the NeIC Training Calendar, please contact [Anne-Marie Bach](https://neic.no/people/anne-marie-bach/). (All courses on the NeIC Training Calendar are available for application).
 
### Deadline
The application process as described here has cut-off dates twice a month, generally on the 1st and 15th of each month, but not outside the holiday periods. The cut-off dates are announced at [NeIC’s training page](/training).            

### Assessment of applications
Twice monthly (e.g. 1st and 15th or first working day thereafter) an assessment will be done by [Anne-Marie Bach](https://neic.no/people/anne-marie-bach/) and [Michaela Barth](https://neic.no/people/michaela-barth/).

### Criterias for assessment are
  * Impact of the training
  * Rarity of the course
  * Timeliness
  * Distribution of gathered knowledge afterwards
  * Significant amount 


### Process
The applications will be reviewed and information about the outcome will take place at the latest 5 working days after the cut-off date.

In case of a successful grant, the applicant will have to prepay the travel and will then be reimbursed upon sending the original bills physically and after having filled out the survey provided.
Review of each application is done by the Ratatosk training programme manager and the NeIC representative in the Steering Group of the Ratatosk training programme.
The notification process is typically 1 week after review (5 working days).
