<h1> Past training events </h1>

<p> This page contains past events from the NeIC <a href="https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Training">training calendar</a>, which includes both NeIC training and stakeholder training which NeIC either participates in or simply wants to advertize. You may also want to look for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/training/upcoming">upcoming training events</a>.

<span class="event-list">
<script>
function foo(widget) {
  var calendarid = "ouebfn9g5muu6l7vjd9hhf0lp4%40group.calendar.google.com";
  var key = "AIzaSyCgPT9r5VFeFpxFkcPNCR7ae-wAnGE9684";
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
    renderEvents(widget, calendarid, key, true, "", "");
  });
}
foo(document.scripts[document.scripts.length - 1].parentNode);
</script>
</span>
